Changes from 2.1
================

- Fixed a bug in the algorithm that prunes away unnecessary parts of
  the pedigree. The bug could be triggered when the number of individuals
  that are eliminated is relatively large (a substantial fraction of the
  size of the pedigree).
  

Changes from 2.0.2
==================

- Now can use 64 bit addressing on 64 bit operating systems, so you
  can use oodles of memory (but only if you have oodles of RAM). This
  assumes that the compiler uses the LP64 model where data types
  'long' and 'pointer' are 64 bits but 'int' is 32 bits (gcc behaves
  this way). Compile using 'make 64'.

Changes from 2.0.1
==================

- Now, the program checks the pedigree for non-founders who have
  one known and one unknown parent and fails with an error message
  if this occurs.
